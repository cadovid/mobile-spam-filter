# Building a mobile spam filter with the multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm

In this project we are going to teach the machine how to classify messages using the multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm. To accomplish this, we are going to take advantage of Bayes' Theorem and other probability resources. The project is developed over Python language.
